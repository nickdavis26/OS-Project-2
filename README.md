The banker.cpp file demonstrates the banker
algorithm and uses the input file (input.txt)
to get the values for the allocation array, max 
array, and the values for the available resources.

The first line of the input file has the available 
resources, the following 5 lines have the values of 
the allocation matrix, and the last 5 lines are the 
values of the max matrix.
